**Match Flow (In Progress)**

Match Flow is a full-stack project developed solely by me to help manage relationship progress in a structured and intentional way. 
The idea came from observations I made among friends who struggled to build authentic relationships through online connections. 
I wanted to create something that encourages meaningful interaction and helps track progress beyond the early stages of a relationship.
The application functions as a lightweight relationship CRM, allowing users to track interactions, set weekly goals, and visualize progress over time. 
While the concept is personal in origin, the project focuses heavily on real-world engineering challenges and scalable backend design.

**Tech Stack**

- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL (migrated from SQLite during development)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Client-side framework: AngularJS (used minimally for data handling)

**Key Features**

- User authentication and session management
- Relational database design with foreign key constraints
- Weekly goal tracking and progress aggregation
- CRUD operations for people, notes, goals, and activities
- Secure database access using PDO and prepared statements

This project is actively being developed and refined.
A live demo will be available soon.
